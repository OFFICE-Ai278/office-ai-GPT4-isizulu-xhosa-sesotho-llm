OFFICE Ai - Open Source Project is a 10-year initiative to build GPT-4 grade foundational language models for isiZulu, isiXhosa, and Sesotho. Includes data curation, slang integration, instruction tuning, and GGUF model releases.



These models aim to preserve, empower, and modernize the use of these languages in AI-driven applications, bridging linguistic gaps and supporting digital inclusivity. The project targets foundational models at GPT-4-grade quality.

Project Timeline & Approach
Years 1–5: Data Curation & Preparation
The first five years will focus on meticulously curating and refining diverse linguistic datasets critical for foundational model training. This includes gathering written and spoken corpora from peer-reviewed sources and everyday language use.

First 11 Months of Each Year: Translation & Slang Factor Integration
During the first 11 months of each year, extensive translation efforts will convert English and other language corpora into isiZulu, isiXhosa, and Sesotho.
Special emphasis will be placed on incorporating contemporary slang and evolved colloquial expressions, reflecting the living nature of these languages.

Month 12 of Each Year: Model Training & Deployment
By the twelfth month, the curated datasets will be used to train the foundational models on cloud-based GPU infrastructure. The resulting models will be released in GGUF format for efficient deployment and broad compatibility.

Years 5–10: Instruction Tuning & Refinement
The latter five years will be dedicated to the instruct phase, where the foundational models undergo instruction tuning and fine-tuning to improve usability, safety, and alignment with user needs — enabling advanced natural language understanding and generation.

Team & Funding
We aim to employ 100 skilled linguists to lead translation, annotation, and validation.
Funding will come from a combination of:

Crowdsourced contributions

Self-funding initiatives

Donor grants

Data Sources
Our primary sources will be peer-reviewed content and publicly available datasets, ensuring high-quality and reliable linguistic data.

Team Structure
As part of the OFFICE Ai Open Source LLM initiative, the project will operate with five specialized teams:

Four teams will focus on translation, using the Web Speech API to accelerate spoken-language data capture and increase productivity.

One team will handle quality assurance, reviewing and correcting the work of the translation teams to ensure accuracy and consistency.

This workflow ensures fast, high-quality dataset creation for robust LLM training.

Vision
Through OFFICE Ai, we aim to empower developers, researchers, and communities with powerful AI tools that honor linguistic heritage while pushing technological frontiers.

We envision the resulting LLMs, a decade from now, benefiting over 300 million speakers of these languages.
We believe the future of AI lies in language-specialized models — e.g., a dedicated Spanish AI, isiZulu AI, or French AI — as only then can AI truly benefit humanity.
